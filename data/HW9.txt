Homework 9

Part 1:
Create a parameterized template with test data for the following site:
https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/basic.php

tests:
1 + 2 = 3
4 / 0 = Not a Number
4 / 3 = 1.3333333333
9 * 5 = 45
0 - 4 = -4

Your test should CLICK the numbers, NOT ENTER them using send_keys



Part 2:
Using the site above create another test which uses the 'random' package
to choose random numbers to click AND random operator (+, -, /, *) to click.
Then asserts that the result is what you calculated usig python.
Again, the challenge is NOT USE send_keys.


Bonus Challenge:
Improve the code in Part 2 to enter by clicking multi-digit numbers.
Example:
456 + 234
501 - 33
4 - 299
1206 * 28
12 / 2
