Homework 2

Create python function that performs the following action:

1) takes 2 lists as input
2) checks if the lists have same numbers, regardless of order
3) does not effect the original order within either list
4) return True if the lists have the same numbers
or False if they have different numbers

Example:

[1,3,5,7] AND [7,1,5,3]  ->  True
['a', 'b', 'c'] AND ['a', 'b', 'd'] -> False
[9,8,7,6,5] AND [9,8,7,6] -> False

Part 2:
Test your function using a unittest.TestCase class

Create at least 2 negative test cases, and at least 6 total test cases.

Hint:
        self.assertEqual(a,d)
        self.assertListEqual(a,d)
        self.assertTrue(a==d)
