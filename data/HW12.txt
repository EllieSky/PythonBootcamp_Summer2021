Homework:

Located test_create_employee_no_creds within the tests.test_create_employee module.
Debug the test - it need several explicit waits added to work (WebDriverWait)
Once the test works, optimize the code and convert to Page Object Model (POM)

You will need to create additional page objects:
AddEmployeePage
PersonalDetailsPage
JobPage

Good Luck!
